## Member Tasks
### Truong Son Nguyen - (ASU ID: 1225266250)
 - I am responsible for programming the handler.py file which takes events every time a user uploads a video to the input bucket and processes it to identify the student in such video. Then querying for the student's information from the DynamoDB database, parse it as a csv file and save to the output bucket.
 

### Abhradeep Roy â€“ (ASU ID: 1224961634).

 - I mainly focused on creating the docker images and pushing the images into the ERC repository. I, along with Aman was responsible for end to end testing of the application along with debugging and modifying the handler.py in some places. We were responsible for verifying and comparing the output csv files and checking if they are consistent with the data in student.json tuple.

### Aman Jain  -  (ASU ID: 1224726750)
 - I mainly focussed on setting up AWS configuration and required resources for the project. For instance, I configured the required IAM roles to run lambda function. Additionally, I created an ECR repository for the lambda function where the docker image is pushed. I created a script to dump student_data.json data to the DynamoDB table. Furthermore, I worked on creating S3 buckets for input and output. When the setup was complete, I along with Abhradeep performed end to end testing to check the whole flow.
